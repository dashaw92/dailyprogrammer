summary:
Given an 11-digit number, find the 12th digit that would make a valid UPC. You may treat the input as a string if you prefer, whatever is more convenient. If you treat it as a number, you may need to consider the case of leading 0's to get up to 11 digits. That is, an input of 12345 would correspond to a UPC start of 00000012345.
